        "titre_h2": "Where can you find vaginal cysts?",
        "contenu": "The vagina is part of the female reproductive system. If you have a vaginal cyst, you might feel it on the lips of the vagina (labia) or at the opening of the vagina. Vaginal cysts can also be found in the vagina — the canal that connects the cervix to the outside of the body."

        "titre_h2": "What are the different kinds of vaginal cysts?",
        "contenu": "There are several different types of vaginal cysts: Inclusion cysts: These are small cysts on the wall of the vagina. They often form during injury to the vagina, possibly during childbirth or after vaginal surgery. Tissue gets trapped under the surface of the vagina and causes a cyst. This is the most common type of vaginal cyst. Bartholin gland cysts: This type of cyst is characterized by fluid or pus-filled bumps or abscesses that form at the opening of either side of the vagina. They are named after the Bartholin glands, which produce the fluid that lubricates the labia (lips of the vagina). A cyst forms when these glands get blocked. If the cyst becomes infected with bacteria, an abscess forms. Sebaceous cysts: These are cysts that develop when oil-producing sebaceous glands of the vulva (external genitalia) become blocked. This will form a lump filled with a yellow-white, greasy material. Gartner’s duct cysts: The Gartner’s duct is an organ present during a person's fetal development. They typically go away before birth. If they do not, these ducts can form cysts on the walls of the vagina later in a person's life. Müllerian cysts: These are a type of cyst that forms from leftover material in the Mullerian ducts during fetal development. They can grow on the walls of the vagina later in life. Cysts may appear as a result of endometriosis or benign tumors, but this is uncommon. Most cysts are not harmful unless they become infected."

        "titre_h2": "What causes a cyst on your vagina?",
        "contenu": "The cause of vaginal cysts can vary depending on the type of cyst. Some common causes of vaginal cysts can include: Injury: An inclusion, Gartner’s duct, or Müllerian vaginal cyst that forms from rips or tears during childbirth or from an injury to the vaginal wall during surgery. These types of cysts occur without you knowing. You cannot prevent these cysts. Gland or duct blockage: Bartholin’s gland and sebaceous cysts happen when a duct or gland becomes blocked or clogged, causing fluid, pus, oil, or other materials to collect and form a lump. These can become painful if infected. Using good hygiene may prevent infection of these types of cysts. Infection: Bacteria from sexually transmitted infections (STI’s) like gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause a vaginal cyst to become infected. It is important to practice safe sex practices like wearing a condom."

        "contenu": "Treatment for a vaginal cyst should be directed by your healthcare provider. Even if it’s a treatment option that you can do at home, it’s best to talk to your provider first. Do not try to drain or squeeze a cyst because this could cause infection. You may want to get rid of a vaginal cyst on your own, but your healthcare provider will decide the best treatment. Some treatments for vaginal cysts may include: A sitz bath: Sit in a bathtub with a few inches of warm water several times a day. This can provide comfort and promote healing. Antibiotics: If your cyst becomes infected, your provider may prescribe antibiotics. Surgical draining: A small tube called a catheter will be inserted into the cyst to drain fluid. These are usually left in place for several weeks. Marsupialization: The cyst is surgically opened and drained. Then, the surgeon will stitch the edges of the cyst wall to form a permanent open pocket or “pouch” for continuous drainage."

They will be able to diagnose and treat your cyst after a thorough exam of the area. Discuss any concerns you have or pain you’ve experienced so that a clear diagnosis can be made. Your healthcare provider will recommend the appropriate care you need."
